## [Object Detection and Classification Using Deep Neural Networks (YOLOv4)](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/M_Faramarzi/publication/342179672_Road_Damage_Detection_and_Classification_Using_Deep_Neural_Networks_YOLOv4_with_Smartphone_Images/links/5f15fe754585151299ab4f38/Road-Damage-Detection-and-Classification-Using-Deep-Neural-Networks-YOLOv4-with-Smartphone-Images.pdf)

In this study TensorFlow implementation of tiny-YOLOv2, Dark-net Neural Networks YOLOv3, tiny-YOLOv3 and YOLOv4 were used to train a road damage detection model with the data set provided by the IEEE Big-data Cup Challenge, and results were compared in the term of the accuracy and runtime speed with other similar studies using different models.
As could be seen in the Figure below, road damages could be detected with acceptable precision, however it still could be improved. One way of improvement is using deeper neural networks such as state of Art Scaled-YOLOv4. Another way is using data augmentation to increase the number samples in unbalanced classes.
