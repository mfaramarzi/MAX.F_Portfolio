## [Road Damage Detection and Classification Using Deep Neural Networks (YOLOv4) with Smartphone Images](https://github.com/mfaramarzi/Masoud-Road-Damage-Detection)

In this study TensorFlow implementation of tiny-YOLOv2, Dark-net Neural Networks YOLOv3, tiny-YOLOv3 and YOLOv4 were used to train a road damage detection model with the data set provided by the IEEE Big-data Cup Challenge, and results were compared in the term of the accuracy and runtime speed with other similar studies using different models.
